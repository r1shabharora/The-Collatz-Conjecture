- **Highest Peaks**: Numbers like 703, 937 (peaking at 250,504)
- **Interesting Patterns**: Powers of 2 have predictably short sequences

### Statistical Findings
- Average sequence length: ~60-70 steps
- Most sequences reach their peak within the first 30 steps
- Execution time correlates with sequence length
- Weak correlation between starting number and sequence characteristics
